Code Design
=====
* Use functional programming
* Use a design pattern
* Use Enum and Switch-Case instead of If-Else
* Use Ternary Operator `? :` instead a single If-Else
* Optimization
  * Compute elapsed time
  * 90% of the problems can be solved using hashmap and priority queue
  * Use Bitwise operations
    * `&` bitwise AND
    * `|` bitwise inclusive OR
    * `^` bitwise XOR (eXclusive OR)
    * `<<` left shift
    * `>>` right shift
    * `~` bitwise NOT
