NP examples
=====
* P -> time comlexity = O(n^3) # Always fixable with acceptable time
* NP -> time comlexity = O(3^N) # Too hard to fix
* NP-Complete -> time complexity = O(3^N) AND will never find a P solution even divided it into multiple smaller problems # Extremely hard to fix and unable to find an easy way
