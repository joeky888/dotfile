# Use mpv to generate thumbnail even if ffmpeg is found in PATH

# which can break the resulting thumbnails. You have been warned.
# To use ffmpeg, set this to no.

# Using 150 will result in a thumbnail every ~10 seconds for a 25 minute video

# The above target count will be adjusted by the minimum and
# maximum time difference between thumbnails.
# The thumbnail_count will be used to calculate a target separation,
# and min/max_delta will be used to constrict it.

# In other words, thumbnails will be:
# - at least min_delta seconds apart (limiting the amount)
# - at most max_delta seconds apart (raising the amount if needed)
# 120 seconds will add more thumbnails only when the video is over 5 hours long

# Below are overrides for remote urls (you generally want less thumbnails, because it's slow!)
# Thumbnailing network paths will be done with mpv (leveraging youtube-dl)
